# satellite-orbit-shape-parameters
This is Satellite communications courses' Final Research Project on visualizing satellite orbit parameters Supervised by: ***Dr.Eman Seraj*** 

* Desgin program of the satellite system by using any programming language (
matlab , python ...............................) to get the relationship between satelillte
orbit shape parameters show in figure below. {***I Choosed Python as visualizing is much more flexable***}
* Compare your result in each case.
* Sketch the orbit relation shape in different scale
