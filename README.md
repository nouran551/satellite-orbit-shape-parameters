**1- Survey on each application to identify the operation , frequency bands ,
.................................................. etc**
* Desgin program of the satellite system by using any programming language (
matlab , python ...............................) to get the relationship between satelillte
orbit shape parameters show in figure below.
* Compare your result in each case.
* Sketch the orbit relation shape in different scale
